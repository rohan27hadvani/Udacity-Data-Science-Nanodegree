## Project: Analyzing Singapore's AirBnB listings
Airbnb, Inc. is an online marketplace for organizing or offering accommodation, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the property listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking. The business is based in San Francisco, California, USA.

The company was founded after the creators installed an air mattress in their living room, essentially transforming their apartment into a bed and breakfast, in order to account for the high cost of rent in San Francisco; Airbnb is a simplified version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.

In this project we are going to use the CRISP - DM( Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) technique to answer a few questions:

1. What are room types do guests prefer the most?
2. Which neighbourhood of Singapore has the maximum number of properties?
3. Which neighbourhood is the most expensive?
4. Which area of singapore has the maximum reviewed properites?
5. Which properties are availaible for how many days?
6. What are the basic amenities offered and is the price of the property associated with luxury amenities?

## Installations
This project has been written in Pyhton 3 and it contains the following libraries:

1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. MatplotLib
5. Plotly.express

## Files
Dataset listings.csv available for Singapore AirBnB listings will be used. Analyzing Singapore's AirBnB listings.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook which contains code as well as is structured to understand the course of analysis.

## Motivation
As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project to write a Data science blogpost using CRISP-DM. I was intriguted to analyze and find business related questions about airbnb listings for Singapore. This interest stem from being a frequent user of airbnb and a person who loves singapore as a city.

This can can be modified to analyze other data sets other than singapore data.

## Analysis
We have initially imported the data from the airbnb inside website. We then have cleaned the data and made it ready for use. Then we visualized the various questions posted at the top using various functions and libraries.
